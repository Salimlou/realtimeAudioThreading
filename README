    Realtime Audio Threading

This repo has multiple sub-folders which each explain an aspect
of realtime audio threading.

Communication is done using the JACK ringbuffer, and an Event class.
This method of lock-free message passing will be used consistently
trough each of the examples.

I hope you find these examples useful and can learn from them.
Any questions / queries / comments / thanks, please let me know.
